The project was undertaken in MATLAB/Simulink to study the operational differences between two widely used uninterruptible power supply topologies. Separate models were developed for online and offline UPS systems, each comprising major functional components such as rectifiers, inverters, battery systems, and static switches. The offline UPS model was designed to supply the load directly from the mains under normal conditions, with automatic switchover to the inverter and battery during outages, whereas the online UPS model continuously supplied the load through the inverter, ensuring regulated and uninterrupted power delivery. Simulation waveforms were analyzed to observe input voltage, output voltage, current, and transfer characteristics during transition events. The project provided insights into the design complexity, response time, harmonic performance, and reliability trade-offs between online and offline UPS systems, with particular emphasis on the inverterâ€™s role in maintaining power quality.
